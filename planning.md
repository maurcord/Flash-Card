Learn Cocktails Flash Card

The game is played by showing a picture of a cocktail. The player has to give the correct ingredients for each drink. There are a total of 5 cocktails. For every correct answer, the player is awarded 10 points. Once the player reaches 50 points, you are a bartender! 

//////////////////////

Create 5 Divs(the cards we will be using) in the center of the document.
Each Div(or card)will have a picture of the cocktail on the front.
When the player clicks on the "card" , the card will flip.
On the back of each card will be the ingredients.
Underneath the 5 cards, we will create a green and red box, one correct and one incorrect.
If the player chooses correctly, they will be rewarded with 10 points!
If the player choose incorrectly, they will not receive any points.
Once the player has gotten all 5 drinks ingredients correctly and a score of "50", the player wins!
